# Types of Data
There are 2 kinds of data:
    * Numerical
    * Categorical (non-numerical)

Categorical data doesnt make sense to the model training so it is replaced by numbers, 
for example in a train there is first class second class and general , They can be converted to 0,1,2

## Linear Regression
It involves finding the "line of best fit" (line equally closest to all data points)

So for specefic x you can predict a y using linear regression
It is used when data-points are linearly related
